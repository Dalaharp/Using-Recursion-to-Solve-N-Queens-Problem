 */

/*Description: The code efficiently solves the n-queens problem, where the task is to place n queens 
on an n Ã— n chess board such that no two queens attack each other. The algorithm uses a recursive 
backtracking approach, exploring all possible queen placements row by row while ensuring that each 
placement is safe. The isSafe function verifies the safety of a queen's position, and the main nQueens 
function initializes the chess board and invokes the recursive helper function to count the distinct 
solutions for a given n. Thank you for reviewing my code!!!! :):):)                       */
